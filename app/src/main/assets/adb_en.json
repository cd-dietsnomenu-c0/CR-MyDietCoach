Slightly fry the white onion and chopped green onions in rings in a skillet with butter. Now add the indicated amount of curry, garlic and cumin , stew everything over low heat. Cut carrots and celery into cubes, chop white cabbage, pick cauliflower inflorescences, chop tomatoes and send all this together with frying to a saucepan, pouring water. Boil for about 10-15 minutes. Then add coriander, vegetable cubes , lavrushka, chopped pepper pod and all other seasonings. Now we bring the soup to readiness, until all the vegetables are fully cooked. It is advisable not to salt the soup or add a little salt.   nDuring the diet, you can only eat Bonn soup, eating it in small portions when you feel hungry. If you cannot boast of truly iron willpower, then you should not test your patience and psychological attitude. On each of the dietary days, it is allowed to include other products in the diet, in addition to the signature dish. They, too, like soup, should be consumed when hunger appears, but still controlling the impulses of your appetite.   nOn the first day, any fruits are allowed, it is not recommended to eat only bananas. On the second day, we eat green vegetables, but at dinner you can afford one boiled or baked potato with a drop of vegetable oil. On the third day, we eat any fruit and vegetable products (but today we do not eat potatoes). On the fourth day, according to the rules for losing weight in Bonn soup, it is allowed to eat bananas (no more than three pieces) and drink some low-fat milk. On the fifth day, the liquid dish is accompanied by a small amount of lean chicken breast or fish, fresh tomatoes. On the sixth day, along with the soup, it is allowed to include in the menu a lean beef chop (or simply this boiled meat) plus any vegetables (except potatoes). And on the seventh diet day, you can eat brown rice and non-starchy vegetables.   nDrink at least 2 liters of water and your favorite tea (preferably herbal or green) without sugar every day. All other foods and drinks, if you want to lose onerous pounds, now need to be eliminated. ",

        "introduction": "In addition to special nutrition for transforming the legs and the whole body, we recommend that you pay attention to a few additional tricks that will help you get the desired shape as soon as possible. Walk a lot and go swimming. Such aerobic exercises are not burdensome and enjoyable, they develop the muscles of the legs remarkably. Moreover, the muscles of the extremities work even when you are just lying on the water. The body receives energy released from oxygen. As a result, glucose interferes with the oxidation process, fat is burned more actively, the mood improves, and the body happily loses weight. Is it not a miracle? n   Drink water correctly! Very often fat deposits in the leg area, and throughout the body, are the result of improper drinking regime. We have repeatedly heard that you need to drink enough fluids daily. But in order to quickly get rid of excess fat in the leg area and reduce the appearance of unattractive cellulite, we recommend that you pay attention to more one trick. Drink liquid regularly: 2-3 times an hour, 20-30 milliliters. This drinking behavior promises to speed up the metabolism as quickly as possible and push the weight loss process you are striving for. The so-called ethnic teas (Chinese pu-erh, Paraguayan mate) will also be a good helper from liquids. When brewed correctly, these drinks not only help to pacify an uncontrollable appetite, but also accelerate the breakdown of fat, improving lymph flow, which is very important in this situation.   nWear corrective underwear. Corrective underwear, as well as slimming tights, can correct the imperfection of the figure. Such clothes can not only create a more attractive figure, beautifully processing the line of the knees, hips, ankles. If the linen is made with high quality, then it still has an anti-varicose effect and helps to eliminate the negative consequences of a sedentary lifestyle.   nUse a self-tanner. Try to feel the effect of artificial sun on yourself and you will notice that the skin has not only become darker and more attractive, but also your legs have visually lost weight. However, it is important to note that in order to apply self-tanning, you need to have certain skills and abilities. Therefore, for beginners in this business, it is better to use toning wipes, which have a similar effect.   nTry to work while standing. Do you work in an office? Do at least part of your office work without sitting. Ask yourself the question: Do you need to sit during all of your work? Most likely, the answer will be no. So take action, sometimes all ingenious is really simple.   nDo scrubbing. This cosmetic procedure is easy to carry out at home. Pamper your calves and thighs with a scrub, it is very useful. This method improves the microcirculation of lymph and blood, helps to get rid of many dead skin particles, makes the skin more elastic and helps to better absorb the effect of any subsequent procedure (mask, wrapping or just applying a cream).

        "menuText": "Of course, any problem is easier to prevent. So that the legs do not rush to increase in volume and do not increase the chances of meeting cellulite, which often makes the fair sex sad, you need to monitor your daily diet. Pay attention to the list below and try as you can rarely communicate with food that has a place in it, if you want to achieve beauty and slender legs and a figure in general.   nPastry. Mouth-watering buns, fatty cakes and other similar products from pastry are recognized as the most dangerous. It has a high nutritional value and with frequent ingestion, it increases body weight and causes formations from the orange peel. Often at work, with a busy schedule, people snack on purchased pies, pizzas and all kinds of pastries. This behavior is a direct road to unpleasant body changes.   Sugar. In addition to harm to the figure but it also worsens the condition of the skin, and can become serious if used excessively. rose for health. So it is highly advisable, if you cannot drink coffee and tea that are completely unsweetened, replace sugar with natural honey, or at least use brown instead of white sugar. According to the opinion of many doctors and scientists, 100 grams is considered the acceptable daily value of sugar. But it's important to understand that this applies not only to pure sugar, but also to the hidden sweetness found in many foods.   Fast food. All fast food is harmful, to which you can also add sausages and other sausage products. This also includes semi-finished products, for the preparation of which you need to spend a minimum of time, which is why so often people indulge in them.   Coffee. It has been scientifically proven that drinking coffee can also form an unattractive crust on the thighs. This is, first of all, about the soluble form of this drink. If you have cellulite, but find it difficult to completely give up coffee, leave it in your diet in a small amount (limit one or two cups a day) and switch to ground coffee.    • Alcohol. Not to mention the harm to the body of alcoholic beverages in large quantities, their consumption has an extremely negative effect on the figure. For example, various liqueurs contain a large number of calories, and a second pile of such a drink is often equated in nutritional value to almost a full meal. And beer, which is consumed by so many people, involves the accompanying absorption of a large amount of fat for a snack, and after that not only extra centimeters appear on the legs, but also a beer belly and other privileges grow.   Chocolate and sweets. Everyone knows that chocolate improves mood. But for this effect, it is very important to have willpower and stop eating about 30 grams of this sweet with a high cocoa content. Otherwise, it is unlikely that it will be possible to avoid gaining extra pounds and meeting with cellulite formations. Use topical chocolate more often. Do, for example, a hot anti-cellulite body wrap or other useful procedure.   Salt. You need to consume it, but in a minimal amount. After all, it is famous for its ability to retain excess fluid in the body, and this leads to deformation of the fat layer. The main results of this are puffiness, which increases the body in volume, cholesterol plaques and deterioration of the kidneys.   To make the legs lose weight, a special diet will help. Its main motto is the introduction into the diet of the maximum amount of food that is useful for the figure and the body, the rejection of harmfulness. Every day you need to drink at least 1.5 liters of water, and from other drinks, focus on unsweetened green tea, hibiscus, freshly squeezed vegetable and fruit juices.   nInclude in the menu raw, boiled and baked vegetables and fruits, berries, rich in vitamin C (strawberries, black currants, rose hips, mountain ash, sea buckthorn, etc.), foods rich in potassium (potatoes, honey, grapes, avocado, broccoli, milk). An important place in the diet aimed at acquiring attractive and slender legs is also given to such gifts of nature as watermelons and melons. They perfectly help to remove unnecessary fluid from the body, burn the hated fat. An alternative to fatty meat products, which is now recommended to be abandoned, is its low-fat analogue (for example, chicken meat). ",

        "introduction": "According to historical data, scientists assume that the yogis and Buddhists of Asia were the first admirers of vegetarianism. From there this system migrated to European countries. In the post-Soviet space, one of the first known vegetarians was the writer Leo Tolstoy. After him, this dietary system became widespread.   nIf just a few decades ago, vegetarianism meant a diet method in which people do not eat meat, now there are many different variations. The main types of vegetarianism include veganism, lacto-vegetarianism and lacto-vegetarianism.   n the strictest types of this food, according to the rules of which meat of animals and birds, fish, seafood, eggs, dairy and sour milk products are excluded from the menu.Many vegans deny themselves even honey.Lacto-vegetarianism is a type of food in which it is possible to exclude from forbidden foods milk and dairy products. lacto-vegetarianism means lacto-vegetable-egg vegetarianism. In addition to milk, it is permissible to include poultry eggs from animal products in the diet. ",

        "menuText": "The principles of a vegetarian diet, designed for 14 days, are similar to lacto-veganism. You can consume milk and eggs from animal products. If you have not previously dealt closely with vegetarianism, it is better to start with just such a type, so as not to shock the body with cardinal changes in eating behavior. If you are an avid meat eater, it is permissible even to include low-fat fish and seafood in the menu in small quantities. Make up your diet based on the main recommendations of the methodology and taking into account your taste preferences, characteristics and capabilities of the body.   nEat during a vegetarian diet for two weeks will need cereals, fruits, vegetables, berries, low-fat or low-fat dairy and sour-milk products.Also, recall the need to consume enough liquid - up to 2 liters of still water daily.It is also allowed to drink tea of ​​any kind without adding honey and sugar ( except in rare cases that are described on the menu below), freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. Although vegetarians are allowed to include some sweets in their diet, when following the rules of this method, it is better to exclude everything, leaving only occasionally a little honey. You are still losing weight.   nOnce you finish your diet, if you do not plan to become a vegetarian, gradually return to your usual diet. Add the previously forbidden foods little by little and do not get carried away with flour and sweets. Otherwise, alas, the weight lost with such difficulty can easily return. If you want to not only improve your body, but also decide to experience this way of eating and living on yourself, this diet can be a good start. If this is the case, continue eating the vegetarian diet of your choice, but increasing the calorie intake and crunching the meals.   nBefore switching to a vegetarian diet, we suggest that you learn the pros and cons. The undoubted advantage of vegetarianism is that it detoxifies the body in the most powerful way. Plant foods contain a lot of fiber, which gently and gently cleanses our body. And the ease of digestion of this type of product does not force the stomach to strain. Vegetarian food helps to normalize cholesterol levels and strengthens the immune system, helping to strengthen it. Also, a plus for the body is that vegetables, fruits, berries, grains contain a great variety of vitamins, phytoncides, minerals that have a positive effect on the work of many organs and systems.   nBut vegetarianism (especially in the hard version) has certain disadvantages ... People who adhere to it, suffering from a lack of iron entering the body, may become victims of iron deficiency anemia. There is also iron in plant foods, but it is poorly absorbed (when compared with that contained in animal products). Hence this problem may arise. Also, in a vegetarian menu, vitamin B12 may not be enough, which is why there is a possibility of encountering diseases of the nervous system. It is difficult with vegetarianism to produce some hormones and enzymes necessary for the body. If you refuse fish and seafood, as scientists note, cardiovascular diseases and vision problems (in particular, the development of cataracts, clouding of the lens) can develop. So if you decide to eat a vegetarian diet for a long time (or even always), take care of the delivery of vitamin B12 to the body, as well as taking a special complex with omega-3 fatty acids. ",

After dinner, you need to forget about food until the next day and, if hunger occurs, suppress it only with unsweetened tea and water. You can, of course, and coffee. But at night it is better not to abuse this drink, otherwise, instead of the disappearance of the desire for a snack, you may encounter insomnia.   nSince this technique is practically carbohydrate-free, its developers do not call for sports. Moreover, it is recommended, during the period of following the rules of the magic diet, to abandon any activities that can take a lot of your strength from you. Low-calorie protein diets will not be easy to replenish. It is quite possible to limit yourself to a simple and short morning exercise or gymnastics. But getting enough sleep (sleeping at least 8 hours) and being in the fresh air for an hour or two a day is more than desirable. This will help the body recover faster and tolerate dietary rules more easily. Also, the developers of the diet advise to pamper yourself with water treatments, massage and fully relax. It is better to follow such a diet during vacation, when you can afford to lie on the couch more than usual and go for a relaxing procedure (or carry it out at home).   nTo save the obtained result and not harm the body, you need to get out of the magic diet smoothly and carefully. The basic rules for leaving the diet regimen include recommendations for the day. Previously prohibited foods should be added gradually.   nOn the first day after the seven-day diet, it is better not to introduce anything new at all. Just increase the amount of food allowed on the diet a little. For example, use a few boiled eggs for breakfast, for lunch - up to 300 g of stewed vegetables, and for dinner - fresh vegetable salad.   nInclude a little boiled meat or lean fish (as an option, your favorite seafood) in the diet of the second day.   nOn the third day after the magic diet, add some cereals or durum wheat pasta to the menu. If you really want something sweet, allow yourself a little, but in the morning.   nNext, expand the range of vegetables and fruits. Eat whatever you want. Do this on days four to seven.   nAnd only after a week has passed, you can add other foods to the diet, not forgetting about proper nutrition and not overeating. Otherwise, with such an effort, the kilograms that have left you may say hello again. And now it will be very good (regardless of whether you were friends with sports during the diet or before it started) to help keep your weight normal with the help of physical activity and the study of problem areas. This will make you not only slim, but also contribute to the acquisition of an attractive, elastic body. ",

Average plumb weights - 2-3 kilograms. It is noteworthy that at the same time people did not change their habits and ate in the usual way Doctors recorded a pleasant bonus in the form of a decrease in insulin levels in the participants' blood.Imagine what results can be achieved with the help of grapefruit, if at the same time you introduce reasonable changes in your diet and turn it towards the correct moderate-calorie diet.   nWorth noting that the bitter peculiar taste of this fruit may not be to everyone's liking. There are some tricks that will increase the chances of loving grapefruit, even for those who were previously skeptical about its use. The main part of the bitterness is concentrated precisely in the partitions of the fruit. Try to simply eat grapefruit without them (for example, with a special spoon with sharp edges, which will help you choose the pulp in the most convenient way). When purchasing grapefruit, make sure that it is not too soft. If, when you press your finger, a dent forms on the citrus, then it is overripe. You do not need to buy such a fruit. It is not recommended to purchase a very hard grapefruit, since, on the contrary, it has not yet ripened. It should be of medium hardness - firm, but not soft. ",

        "introduction": "This nutrition system does not prescribe a clear time frame. You can eat this way for quite a long time. The diet of a fitness diet is close to correct and balanced. You can occasionally allow yourself deviations without going into food binges, otherwise the results from even the most strong training will take a very long time. ",

        "menuText": "So, what to eat on a fitness diet? This technique has two main food heroes - proteins and carbohydrates you know.   nCarbohydrates (scientifically - carbohydrates) are necessary in order to provide the body with energy, to nourish it is the brain and nervous system, which is important.In our body, carbohydrates are stored in the liver and muscles and are consumed intensively during exercise and other physical activity.If you notice during sports that the body asks to lie down when you are actively swinging your legs, it is likely that that in this way it is the lack of the right carbohydrates that makes itself felt, which the muscles signal about.   nWhen we talk about the right carbohydrates, we mean carbohydrate-containing products that are absorbed for a long time. These include, in particular, cereals, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and berries (preferably non-starchy and having a low glycemic index). The body's processing of these products provides a gradual release of energy, and it becomes easier for you and exercise more productively.   nBut fast carbohydrates, which are found in high-calorie sweets and soft flour products, are not helpers in this matter. Leaving their abundance in your diet, you run the risk of not only significantly delaying the results of fitness training, but also gaining excess weight. Do you want this outcome? Then strictly control the flow of this type of product. Better yet, give it up altogether, allowing it as a rare exception.   nProteins are also an essential component of a fitness diet. They are a kind of building blocks for building beautiful and correct muscles. Proteins of various types help to restore and build beautiful muscle relief. If you completely deprive the body of proteins, it will simply begin to eat muscles, and then you can definitely forget about attractive forms. And by continuing this lifestyle for a long time, you can even earn muscle dystrophy. While exercising, and in general leading a healthy lifestyle, be sure to introduce low-fat dairy and sour-milk products, meat, fish, seafood, eggs and other healthy proteins into your diet.   nIt is impossible to ignore, speaking of a fitness diet, and fats. Yes, compared to proteins and carbohydrates, there is less fat in such a diet. But to completely abandon them, no matter how strongly and quickly you want to build, is definitely not worth it. Healthy fats contained in vegetable oils, nuts, on the contrary, can contribute to even faster weight loss and achievement of results, while maintaining the proper functioning of the body. But do not use them just before the planned workout. Of course, you need to consume them in moderation, since these foods also contain quite a few calories.   nOf course, you should never forget about water. This liquid in a fitness diet, especially at the stage of active weight loss, is just like air. Water promotes the elimination of breakdown products of proteins and fats, drives out toxins and other harmful substances from the body that can harm it. Also, water supplies muscles with oxygen, relieves muscle pain as much as possible, makes soreness after training less noticeable and helps to quickly find the desired chiseled body. If you feel lethargic, depressed, or severely dry in your mouth, think about how much fluid you are drinking. In the case when your answer is far from the recommended rate (at least one and a half liters per day), the root of the problem is obvious. Be sure to drink water, both before and after sports, and directly during physical activity. ",

Its main characteristics are that the amount of carbohydrate-containing foods is significantly reduced in the diet, and lean protein becomes a source of energy. The fact is that the body spends a lot of energy on its breakdown (more than in the product contains calories), in connection with which fat is broken down and a person loses weight.\n The second participants in the diet menu are fruits and vegetables, which help to provide the body with fiber and essential vitamins that help make the process of losing weight more comfortable without an acute feeling of hunger. they fill the stomach and create a feeling of fullness, when in reality you, as a rule, consume very few calories.\n The distinctive feature of this diet is that it is great for even people who have a normal body weight or are completely slim, but have local deposits of fat, from which one so wants to get rid of. indexer. What matters is how the body looks (the ratio of fat and muscle components). On this diet, just from the fatty tissue, you can get rid of, transforming it into muscle. To make the muscle skeleton more attractive, do not forget about physical activity, especially since there will probably be enough strength for sports, because the diet-ration is quite complete. ",

        "menuText": "So, if you decide to lose weight on a fat-burning diet, be prepared for the fact that the menu will consist of proteins, slow-acting carbohydrates and fiber. It is recommended to take four meals a day, at approximately equal intervals of time (ideally between them should take about 4 hours), excluding meals 3 hours before bedtime.\n We draw attention to the above ingredients and their important role in the process of losing weight and transforming the body. Protein is so important, because it is from it that our muscles are largely composed, as well It is an essential raw material for building cells. Protein speeds up metabolism, helps reduce cravings for sweets, provides the body with sufficient energy, helps to better absorb vitamins and other nutrients that enter the body, and ensures satiety for a long enough period.\n Fiber helps to improve digestion and removes toxins from the body.In this diet, it is especially important, as it will help to remove waste products that form when consuming protein, which is included in the diet in large quantities. Vegetables and fruits are an excellent side dish for protein-containing foods.\n The course of the most important biochemical processes in the body is influenced, of course, by water. Be sure to drink at least one and a half liters of liquid daily. This requirement is especially relevant in the summer season and during training. Otherwise, a lack of water can worsen your well-being and slow down your metabolism, which in no way contributes to more productive weight loss. On a fat-burning diet, it is ideal to drink 2-2.5 liters of clean, non-carbonated liquid every day. Firstly, it will help to start the process of losing weight sooner. Secondly, it will contribute to the removal of breakdown products of protein products, which is also very important for maintaining health. In addition to water, from drinks, not counting liquid fermented milk products, it is better to allow yourself only green tea. Black tea and coffee are available occasionally if you really want to.

The diet is based on the alternation of days. One day is protein, the next is rich in products with the right carbohydrates.   nWhy This method works? As you know, carbohydrates are a kind of fuel for the body, giving us energy. On days when only protein products are supplied, energy becomes insufficient, and the body is forced to expend its own fat reserves. This pushes a stalled metabolism to burn excess calories and , as a result, leads to weight loss. And a carbohydrate day also does not give weight gain, but subject to moderation in the diet. The number of calories received should not be greater than the energy that the body uses.   nAs for the volume of food, they are not clearly regulated Eat until you feel full, but remember that this feeling comes after 20 minutes. chickpeas after starting a meal, so do not rush to pounce on food and swallow it quickly. Try to use it in a calm and measured environment, without being distracted by extraneous things such as watching TV and talking on the phone.   n Do not starve. The body will think that times are lean and, on the contrary, will start stocking up on the fat you want to get rid of.   nDo not take too long pauses between meals. The usefulness and effectiveness of fractional nutrition for weight loss has not been canceled. Try to have at least three meals a day. If there is an easy snack between them - great! ",

The second requirement is from the diet on any days you need to exclude potatoes and products containing flour and sugar in any form. It is undesirable to include bananas with grapes in the diet.   If you threw off an insufficient amount of kilograms in the first week, you can still live with these prohibitions. If you really want to taste the forbidden fruit, allow yourself a little. For example, eat 20 grams of your favorite chocolate, but not a whole bar. This also applies to the period when your weight is already close to ideal. After losing weight, just stick to the principles of alternating days.   nList of recommended foods for protein days:   ndairy and dairy products of low fat or low fat (kefir, fermented baked milk, milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, natural yogurt);    low-fat meat (be sure to remove the skin from it and veins);   Eggs (chicken and quail);   Low-fat fish and seafood.

And other additives are unlikely to benefit the body either. As a last resort, buy an empty low-fat or low-fat product and be careful not to contain sugar.   nBut the best way out of the situation is to make yogurt yourself. Here is its recipe. you need pasteurized milk in an amount of 1-3 liters (depending on how many products you want to cook at a time) and dry yoghurt culture ra (available at many pharmacies). Pour this milk into a sterilized container, boil, cool to about 40 degrees. Now mix a little milk with the yoghurt culture and add the mixture to the main amount of liquid.   nIt is recommended to infuse homemade yoghurt in a yogurt maker or in a thermos. Before placing the liquid in it, the thermos should be doused with boiling water and wiped thoroughly. Having tightly closed the temporary habitat of the future yogurt, you need to let it brew for 12 to 14 hours. Note that the longer the yogurt costs, the more sour it turns out. Now this mixture needs to be sent to the refrigerator so that it will stand there for a couple of hours and thicken. ",

If you can have dinner earlier and then fall asleep without severe hunger pangs, do so. From drinks , in addition to ordinary water, drink green tea without sugar (sometimes black is possible), in which you can add a slice of fresh lemon. It is not necessary to give up empty coffee at all, but do not abuse this drink.

Therefore, it is worth recognizing that weight loss is largely due to the loss of fluid in the body. This rule, if you want to clearly sit on the acting method of losing weight, it is still better to adhere to only the 4-day version. it is worth allowing yourself to drink at least a liter of water a day.

From the products, preference should be given to meat and herbs, green vegetables. And it is desirable that the vegetable portion is always larger than the meat portion.\n If it is not possible to eat the green lettuce recommended by this diet, it is quite possible to replace it with celery, spinach, fresh cucumbers or cabbage. These foods also contain a minimum of calories, but at the same time are rich in fiber, which helps improve digestion and helps to lose weight quickly and comfortable.\n Salads are recommended to be seasoned with freshly squeezed lemon juice, but sometimes you can also use vegetable oil, which is not worth giving up at all. But the priority is still the healthier one - olive oil. Coffee, if you are not a fan of it, or it is contraindicated for you, can be replaced with tea (preferably high-quality green). Be sure to try to drink at least 1.5-2 liters of ordinary water daily s (or non-carbonated mineral). It is advisable to boil, bake or subject the meat to another method of thermal processing, which helps to preserve the maximum useful properties and does not add more calories. From time to time, so that the same type of food does not get bored, the meat can be fried using a small amount of vegetable oil. It is also allowed to replace meat with lean types of fish, but do not roll the fish in flour or breadcrumbs and do not use fatty sauces. Carrots and tomatoes on the menu can be used interchangeably.

Dinner is worth at least three hours before bedtime. If you are used to not eating after 18-19 hours, even in your free time from the diet, you should not deviate from this rule.   nFrom drinking, of course, clean water without gas is a priority. Coffee and tea, if desired, are acceptable, but empty. If it's really hard to drink unsweetened drinks, you can occasionally add a little honey. Sugar is the enemy of your weight loss. ",

But for sweet lovers it is often as difficult to give up sweets as people suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction , from their addictions.   nIn addition to an unattractive figure, craving for sweets often provokes a lot of other troubles. , skin problems.   nAlso, excessive consumption of sweets can lead to emotional instability, increased nervousness, aggressiveness, muscle fatigue, anemia, decreased quality of vision. A direct link has been established between the excessive presence of sugar in the diet and impairment of the cardiovascular system. Sugar can cause a lack of thiamine, and a decrease in the amount Twa of this substance leads to dystrophy of the heart muscle and a host of health complications. And extravascular fluid accumulation, which is also triggered by overweight sugar, can even lead to cardiac arrest! And these are just the main problems.   n Often the reason that people cannot give up sugar is that this white product makes you feel false hunger. The man, it would seem, has just eaten something sweet, and quite high-calorie, and he wants to have a snack again. As scientists have found, when sugar is consumed in the brain, free radicals are released that interfere with the normal functioning of brain cells and provoke hunger when in reality you are full.

Snacks on a sweet diet are not desirable. If it is difficult to survive the time before meals, try to kill the hunger with tea slightly sweetened with honey. This usually works. Any fruit is allowed. But it is better to stop your choice more often on apples, citrus fruits, and not on starchy fruits such as bananas. From vegetables you can do everything except potatoes. It is also not recommended to lean on legumes. Salt vegetable salads is allowed, but a little. If you can for a short diet, completely abandon salty foods - very good To add flavor to the salad, as well as to tea, you can add a little freshly squeezed lemon juice.   nBy the way, high-calorie and harmful sweets should be replaced with more healthy and low in calories. Introduce more fruits, dried fruits (in particular, raisins, prunes, dates) into the diet. Jam (ideally without sugar) or honey can serve as a substitute for sugar in tea and other hot drinks.   nOf the purchased sweets, marmalade and marshmallows are the lowest in calories and are more useful. You can also keep some dark chocolate in your diet. The rest of the sweet products will certainly not bring anything useful to your health or your figure.

Snacks and lunches are not available. If between the main meals, due to the unusual and limited diet, you feel hunger, try to satisfy it with a cup of unsweetened black coffee or tea.\n Of course, drink in your spare time. from meals time clean water (if you can get thawed - just great). Drinking water costs as much as the body asks for. But it is very desirable that the amount of this liquid necessary for the body be at least 1.5 liters per day. In the hot season, it is recommended to drink 2 liters, because the body loses a lot of fluid (in particular with sweat), and its reserves must be replenished. ",

Like most other diets (for example, the apple diet), the Japanese diet requires adherence to a number of strict restrictions : pure carbohydrates should be completely excluded from the diet (any confectionery, sugar, alcohol, etc.) and additionally salt in any form (all kinds of brines are excluded from the diet).

Yesterday, the diet was so tired that I thought I would howl. But I showed creative ingenuity, and made myself this option for lunch: I sprinkled cabbage with tomatoes in a frying pan with a drop of oil, on low heat under the lid, then poured Two beaten eggs. Stirred until the eggs were cooked. Added dill, fresh basil. Believe me, it was the dinner of the gods! I ate all this at work in three meals, so that it would last for the whole day.

Cocoa butter is almost completely absent. As a consequence, the classic chocolate diet cannot be carried out on white chocolate. Also, chocolate with sweeteners is not recommended (for diabetics).   nEach chocolate intake is accompanied by a cup of unsweetened coffee (it is possible with low-fat 1% milk). This requirement is common in all effective diets (the Japanese diet is an example). coffee speeds up metabolism by 1% to 4%, which leads to more intense weight loss (but also in large quantities affects the state of health not for the better).

Taking any liquid (water, green tea) is possible no earlier than 3 hours after taking chocolate and coffee. The minimum fluid intake should not be less than 1.2 liters (preferably more) - this requirement is typical for most fast diets that exclude salt.   nRepeated carrying out the same diet is possible not earlier than in a month or better more - it inflicts a significant blow on the body (although in some sources you can find an alternating weight loss regimen on a chocolate diet - after 7 days of a diet m the minimum interval before repeating is also 7 days).

The essence of the diet is to alternate protein and carbohydrate days. This alternation allows you to burn fat and gain muscle definition. Diet is good. It is combined with sports activities and physical activity and allows you to dry out in a short time. The principle of the LUCH diet is as follows: By restricting carbohydrates, the number of calories consumed by the body is reduced. In the absence of carbohydrates, the body begins to use glycogen reserves. manages to rebuild and begins to use fat as fuel. If carbohydrate reserves are not replenished in time, muscle cells will begin to be burned, which is very harmful. In order to avoid this, you need to eat as much protein food as possible on carbohydrate-free days. In the following days, carbohydrate loading of the body occurs. ... It deceives the body and does not put it into economy mode. ",

Acting in antiphase, these two hormones kill all birds with one stone - allow you to get rid of excess fat without muscle degeneration and poor health associated with a lack of energy and nutrition for the brain.
